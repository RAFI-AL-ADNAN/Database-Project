        <p>
          <b>note: the protein and the fat are calculated in grams.</b> <br />
          First, you need to enter an item in the text area provided (item =
          food). <br />
          Protein and fat measurements are provided in grams. To begin, enter a food item into the designated text area. Once you've inputted the item, pressing the 'Result' button will calculate its protein, calorie, and fat content. If you wish to keep track of this item, click on the 'Add to Calculate’ button. This action will record all nutritional attributes of the item onto your virtual plate. We will soon introduce a feature allowing you to remove specific items from your plate as needed
<br />
          An option to remove specific item from the plate will arraive shortly.
